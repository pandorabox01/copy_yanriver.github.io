# About Me

<img src="/images/yan1.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Chuan Yan(严川).  I am an assistant professor at Institute of Zoology ([IOZ]), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
I joined IOZ in 2010 as a PHD student supervised by [Prof. Zhibin Zhang], and after graduation got the assistant professorship in Animal Ecology Group, IOZ in 2013.
Before that, I was in Lanzhou University, for my bachelor and master studies.

Being a scientist is a dream from my childhood! I am fascinated by both the known and unknown scientific knowledge about the world we are living in, which keeps me going on the path of science. 
At present, my research interests generally lie in population and community ecology. I use statistical and theoretical modeling method to understand
population dynamics and biodiversity.

# About Me

<img src="/images/yan1.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="200">
My name is Chuan Yan.  I am an assistant professor at Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
I joined IOZ in 2010 as a PHD student supervised by Professor Zhibin Zhang, and after graduation got the assistant professorship in Animal Ecology Group, IOZ in 2013.
Before that, I was in Lanzhou University, for my bachelor and master studies.

At present, my research interests generally lie in population and community ecology. I use statistical and theoretical modeling method to understand
the dynamics of population and community. I do not constrain myself in any specific directions, so anything that can help to understan nature interests me, 
such as species interaction, phylogenetic relation, climate, human disturbance, etc.
